# python-solidity-blockchain-smart-contract-course

25th February, 2022.

Hi, my name is Anthony, I'm 19.

This is my first course in the blockchain ecosystem, hopefully, I will make commits to this repository everyday for the next 6 months [i.e February - August]

Hopefully, with over this course of 6 months, I will have what it takes to be a junior solidity engineer, get a solidity or blockchain job, fund my young startup and grow in the blockchain ecosystem.

Thanks.
